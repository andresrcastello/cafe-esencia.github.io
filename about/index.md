# About

Café Esencia is a mediterranean churro café inspired by the rich food culture of La Convivencia.

We serve traditional sourdough churros, fairtrade coffee, as well as mediterranean breakfast and lunch.

Spices and ingredients are sourced for quality and fairness from all around the world. We support our local food system by sourcing fresh produce and herbs from local organic and sustainable farms.

We specialize in traditional sourdough churros called porras. The sourdough culture and simple ingredients keep these churros light and digestible.

In traditional towns all over Andalucía people enjoy these churros daily as part of their mediterranean diet. The traditional batter is closer to bread, as it doesn’t contain egg , sugar, or dairy; and is vegan. It’s up to you how much sugar you want to add, and if you want to dip them in thick delicious hot chocolate or your coffee.

The saying goes “you shouldn’t remember a good churro-maker,” referring to their lightness and contrasting from heavy churros.
